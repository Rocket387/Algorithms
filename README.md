Queues
Enqueue - adds data to the “back” or end of the queue
Dequeue - provides and removes data from the “front” or beginning of the queue
Peek - reveals data from the “front” of the queue without removing it
bounded queue = queue with a limit to the amount of data that can be added 

Underflow = trying to remove elements from an empty queue.
Overflow = trying to add an element to a queue that does not have room for more nodes because it is bounded

Stacks (can be linked list on array, can have a limited size)
Push - adds data to the top of the stack
Pop - removes and provides data from the top of the stack
Peek - reveals data on the top of the stack
StackOverflow - pushing data onto a full stack
